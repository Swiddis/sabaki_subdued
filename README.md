# Sabaki Subdued Theme

## Cold Edition

This is a fork of the original [Subdued Theme by Rooklift](https://github.com/rooklift/sabaki_subdued_theme_40) that turns down the analysis heatmap colors.
I happen to like the blue much more than the original four-color palette.

## Usage

* Theme for [Sabaki SGF editor](https://github.com/yishn/Sabaki) **0.40.0** or later.
* To install, just download the asar file and then, in Sabaki, see Preferences --> Themes.
